## Description
The search for missing persons in rural areas is a problem with great social repercussions, which demands a rapid response from the administrations.  It requires them to be planned in a systematised and organised manner.  The search is an emergency, it requires an immediate response to save lives and minimize risks. They need complex coordination structures for their management:

1. They generate a demand for personnel that is going to be prolonged in time and that exceeds ordinary resources.
1. They require collaboration between Administrations and Institutions of diverse nature.
1. The wild environment in which they are developed entails risks for the members of the search.

For the management of the search are used:

- [x] Geographic Information Systems ([GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)).
- [x] Global Navigation Satellite Systems ([GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation)).
- [x] Real Time Location Systems ([RTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_locating_system)).

The systems currently used to monitor work and record information present a major challenge for this type of emergency. The following questions arise in the management and coordination of such arrangements:

1. The work is being carried out in a hostile environment and many of the people carrying out field tasks are neither professionals nor trained in this type of work.
1. The planned tasks are really being carried out correctly.

**HORUS** is free [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) tool that adapts to the needs of this type of situation, allowing an agile and effective follow-up of the work, and an organized record of the information that facilitates the analysis.
