# HORUS Mobile
Horus Mobile is an [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) application to be deployed over a smart device.  The app will use the GPS sensors to track the information and send to the server. In order to facilitate the user interactivity, it will require the QR codes generated by the search at the HORUS Desktop App. This will contain the info to access to the server and the group assigned to the device.

## HOWTO

### CREATE PLATFORMS
ionic cordova platform add browser
ionic cordova platform add android


### DEBUG FROM BROWSER
ionic serve (after loading web from: localhost:8100)
ionic serve --lab   (after loading web from: localhost:8100/ionic-lab)


### COMPILE BROWSER
ionic cordova build browser --prod --release

### COMPILE ANDROID
  1. make sure your path is setting the jdk bin folder (or add it)
          export PATH=$PATH:/whateverfolderisyourJDK/bin
  2. make sure your android home is setting the nadroid-sdk folder (or add it)
          export ANDROID_HOME=/whateverfolderisyourAndroid-sdk

(if necessary modify from config.xml the android-versionCode and version parameters)

ionic cordova build android --prod --release

  3. if you get an error like this:
Error: Could not find gradle wrapper within Android SDK. Might need to update your Android SDK.
Looked here: /whateverfolderisyourAndroiSDKFolder/tools/templates/gradle/wrapper
    we need to wait a cordova bugfix for this and recent android sdk versions.. 
    until then I've copied an old sdk 'templates' folder onto the new tools folder

the unsigned apk will be at the /platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/ folder

### DEPLOY & DEBUG IN ANDROID
ionic cordova run android


### LIST CONNECTED DEVICES
adb devices
