  1. make sure your path is setting the jdk bin folder (or add it)
          export PATH=$PATH:/whateverfolderisyourJDK/bin
  2. make sure your android home is setting the nadroid-sdk folder (or add it)
          export ANDROID_HOME=/whateverfolderisyourAndroid-sdk

(if necessary modify from config.xml the android-versionCode and version parameters)

ionic cordova build android --prod --release

  3. if you get an error like this:
Error: Could not find gradle wrapper within Android SDK. Might need to update your Android SDK.
Looked here: /whateverfolderisyourAndroiSDKFolder/tools/templates/gradle/wrapper
    we need to wait a cordova bugfix for this and recent android sdk versions.. 
    until then I've copied an old sdk 'templates' folder onto the new tools folder

the unsigned apk will be at the /platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/ folder

deploy & debug in android:
·························
ionic cordova run android


problem running in android
··························
try both:
1. ionic hooks add
2. sudo chmod -R 755 folder_to_android-sdk/


list connected devices
······················
adb devices
